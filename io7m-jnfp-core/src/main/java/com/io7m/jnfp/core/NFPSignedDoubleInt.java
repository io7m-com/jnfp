/**
 * <p>Conversion of signed normalized fixed-point values to and from floating
 * point values.</p>
 *
 * <p>The OpenGL 3.3 specification defines two representations of signed
 * normalized fixed-point values with {@code b} bits of precision. The first
 * representation maps {@code -1.0} to {@code -(2 ^ (b - 1))} and {@code 1.0} to
 * {@code (2 ^ (b -1)) - 1}. This representation does not allow for {@code 0} to
 * be expressed directly. The second representation maps {@code -1.0} to {@code
 * -(2 ^ (b - 1)) + 1} and {@code 1.0} to {@code (2 ^ (b -1)) - 1}, which allows
 * for {@code 0} to be represented exactly but means that {@code -(2 ^ (b - 1))}
 * is outside of the representable range.</p>
 *
 * <p>For lack of better names, this implementation refers to the first
 * representation as {@code without-zero}, and the second as {@code
 * with-zero}.</p>
 *
 * <p>For the {@code without-zero} representation, conversion from signed
 * normalized fixed-point values {@code f} to floating point values {@code x} is
 * defined as:</p>
 *
 * <pre>
 * x = ((2 * f) + 1) / (pow(2, b) - 1)
 * </pre>
 *
 * <p>For the {@code with-zero} representation, conversion from signed
 * normalized fixed-point values {@code f} to floating point values {@code x} is
 * defined as:</p>
 *
 * <pre>
 * x = max (-1.0, f / (pow(2, b - 1) - 1))
 * </pre>
 *
 * <p>For the {@code without-zero} representation, conversion from floating
 * point values {@code x} (assumed to be in the range {@code [-1.0, 1.0]}) to
 * signed normalized fixed-point values {@code f} is defined as:</p>
 *
 * <pre>
 * f = ((x * (pow(2, b) - 1)) - 1) / 2
 * </pre>
 *
 * <p>For the {@code with-zero} representation, conversion from floating point
 * values {@code x} (assumed to be in the range {@code [-1.0, 1.0]}) to signed
 * normalized fixed-point values {@code f} is defined as:</p>
 *
 * <pre>
 * f = x * (pow(2, b - 1) - 1)
 * </pre>
 *
 * <p>This implementation provides general conversion functions that operate on
 * arbitrary values of {@code b}, and specialized functions that operate for
 * specific values of {@code b} using precomputed terms.</p>

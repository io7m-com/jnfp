## jnfp

Java functions to convert between floating point and _normalized fixed point_
values.

## Features

* Conversion between unsigned normalized fixed-point numbers and floating point numbers.
* Conversion between signed normalized fixed-point numbers and floating point numbers.
* High coverage test suite.
* [OSGi-ready](https://www.osgi.org/)
* [JPMS-ready](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Java_Platform_Module_System)
* ISC license.

## Usage

Convert a floating point value to its 32-bit unsigned normalized fixed point
representation:

```
var r = NFPUnsignedFloatLong.toUnsignedNormalized(0.25, 32);
```

Convert a 32-bit unsigned normalized fixed point value to its floating point
representation:

```
var s = NFPUnsignedFloatLong.fromUnsignedNormalized(r, 32);
```

Classes exist for signed, unsigned, `int`, `long`, `float`, and `double`
specializations.
